    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>Unemployment has been a major concern for graduates and other job-seekers for a long time now both in the past and today. There are many causes of unemployment including limited resources, but I will narrow down to unequal distribution of job opportunities as one of the major causes. This means many job seekers do not have sufficient information about job vacancies or rather fail to acquire the information on job vacancies in time. The main reason behind this is the means by which jobs are being sought.</p>
<p>In the past jobs were sought through the following means (Galanaki 2002):
    Employment and recruitment agencies, Job affairs Advertising in the mass media such as newspapers Advertisement in television and radio Management consultants, existing employee contacts, Schools colleges or universities student services department, Workers or professional referrals. However, it is important to note that some of the traditional job-seeking methods are still being used today and have not been replaced completely by the new methods.</p>
    <p>Today there has been massive improvement and development in technology, specifically the internet. The internet in particular is a great resource that has been useful in sharing of information especially through web portals and social sites. The internet is global, fast in terms of information access, sharing and updating. This means that even for the job-seekers it is possible for them to use the internet to search for job vacancies online, share the information among other job-seekers too.  Many job seekers have incurred substantial costs (monetary costs and time wastage) during the job seeking process and sometimes even end up still unemployed. Due to unequal distribution of job opportunities some donâ€™t receive information about job vacancies in time hence failing to secure jobs. The employers too are faced with advertisement costs because their advertisements sometimes reach the general audience rather than the target audience leading to wastage of resources. </p>
<p>Online Job Application system acts as a common online platform where the employers and the job seekers can interact. The employers post the job vacancies on the online platform i.e. advertise the job vacancies, while the job seekers acquire accounts too, log in the portal and view the job vacancies together with their required qualifications. If a job seeker finds a vacancy that he/she desires, he /she can apply for the job by submitting his/her education qualifications and/or skills specific for the job together personal details e.g. curriculum vitae (CV).
